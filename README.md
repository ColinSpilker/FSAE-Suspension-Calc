# 2D-Suspension-Calc
2D Suspension Double Wishbone Solver

it is a jupiter notebook file

download and edit the hardcoded labeled values in the first cell and then hit run all cells as there is a math module as cell 2 and after that are different output modules

# Ackerman-Calc
similar file type

just calculates turning radius and tracks some slip via geometry

less cells as simpler calculation

# Will update more files and tests to this

i plan on running a 4 wheel bycicle simulation to help adjust spring rates

sorry both programs are a bit crude, I am not the best programmer
